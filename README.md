This repository contains my submission for the COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge. The challenge includes building an interactive photo gallery and solving two coding challenges using JavaScript.
Introduction
The Interactive Photo Gallery & Coding Challenges project demonstrates the creation of a responsive photo gallery and solutions to two specific coding problems. The gallery showcases interactivity and design accuracy, while the coding challenges highlight problem-solving skills in JavaScript.
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Musemakkweli/COA-TASKFORCE-CHALLENGE_MUSEMAKWELI_R.B_Arlande-.git

i have two folder ( index and challenge ) 
index contains images, gallery, script.js, stlyse and 
challenge contains arrayManipulation.js, and stringTransformation.js

HTML Structure
The HTML structure was created based on the provided Figma designs.
Each image is wrapped in a <div> element with appropriate classes for styling and interaction.
CSS Styling
CSS was used to style the gallery elements, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy with the Figma designs.
Media queries were implemented to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.
JavaScript Interactivity
JavaScript was used to implement interactivity features such as image navigation and hover interactions.
Additional details are displayed when a user hovers over a photo, as specified in the Figma prototype.
Coding Challenges 
Navigate to the Challenges directory
Open the 'arrayMap.js' and 'stringTransform.js'files in your preferred code editor to view the solutions.
Array Manipulation (arrayMap.js)
I implemented a function to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to the target.
The solution follows the provided problem statement and constraints, achieving the expected time and space complexity.
String Transformation (stringTransform.js)
I implemented a function to transform a string based on the provided rules.
The solution handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem statement and achieves the expected time and space complexity.
